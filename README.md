Smart Parking Using YOLO (You Only Look Once)
Smart parking systems leverage YOLO (You Only Look Once), a deep learning-based object detection algorithm, to enhance efficiency in vehicle detection and parking space management. Here's how YOLO plays a crucial role in smart parking:
1. Vehicle Detection
- YOLO processes live camera feeds to detect and classify vehicles in real time.
- It can identify different types of vehicles (cars, motorcycles, buses) with high accuracy.

2. Vacant Parking Spot Identification
- By analyzing parking lot images, YOLO can detect empty spaces and occupied spots.
- This helps in directing drivers to available parking, reducing traffic congestion.

3. Automated Entry & Exit System
- YOLO-based systems can recognize license plates, allowing automated access.
- Reduces the need for manual ticketing and minimizes entry delays.

4. Traffic Flow Optimization
- With real-time detection, parking management can predict congestion and guide vehicles efficiently.
- YOLO enables dynamic parking allocation and smart navigation.

5. Security & Monitoring
- YOLO helps in detecting unauthorized parking or suspicious activities.
- It can integrate with alert systems for enhanced security.

Smart parking solutions using YOLO minimize human intervention, reduce search time, and optimize parking efficiency
